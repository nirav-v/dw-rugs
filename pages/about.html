        <p>
          During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic people began to take on
          many new hobbies. I too was finding myself struggling to find purpose
          everyday while being stuck at home. One of the hobbies that stuck out
          to me most was rug making. I started to see rug making getting some
          traction and I was always so intrigued by it. Before I even purchased
          any of the materials, I was compiling images of what I wanted my first
          rug to be. After a lot of deliberation, I decided my first rug was
          going to be the Blonde album cover by Frank Ocean.
        </p>

      <p>
        Since then, I have done hundreds of rugs for people all across the
        United States, from podcast logos in Salt Lake City, to BMW M3â€™s in
        California, to dog faces in New York. This has turned into much more
        than a hobby to me, and I am very excited to be sharing this with all of
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for stopping by, and I hope to make a rug for you in the
        future.
